Q3.1

```{r}
# a) Load the 'diamonds' data set in R Studio. 
# How many observations are in the data set?

nrow(diamonds)

# b) How many variables are in the data set?

ncol(diamonds)

# c) How many ordered factors are in the set?

# str(diamonds)
# 3

# d) What letter represents the best color for a diamonds?

levels(diamonds$color)
# help(diamonds)
# D


```

Q3.2

```{r}
# Create a histogram of the price of
# all the diamonds in the diamond data set.

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "DarkOrange", binwidth = 500) +

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + 
  xlab("Price") + ylab("Count")

```

Q3.3

Describe the shape and center of the price distribution. Include summary statistics like the mean and median.
```{r}
summary(diamonds$price)
# 
# The distribution is right-skewed with small amounts of very large prices driving up the mean, while the median remains a more robust measure of the center of the distribution.
```

Q3.4

```{r}

# a) How many diamonds cost less than $500?
diamonds %>%
  filter(price < 500) %>%
  summarise(n = n())

# b) How many diamonds cost less than $250?
diamonds %>%
  filter(price < 250) %>%
  summarise(n = n())

# c) How many diamonds cost more than $15,000?
diamonds %>%
  filter(price >= 15000) %>%
  summarise(n = n())

```

Q3.5

```{r}
# Explore the largest peak in the
# price histogram you created earlier.

# Try limiting the x-axis, altering the bin width,
# and setting different breaks on the x-axis.

Q3.6
```{r}
# Break out the histogram of diamond prices by cut.

Q3.7

# a) Which cut has the highest priced diamond?
# Premium

# by(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, max)

```

Q3.8

```{r}
# In the two last exercises, we looked at
# the distribution for diamonds by cut.

# Run the code below in R Studio to generate
# the histogram as a reminder.

# ===============================================================

# ===============================================================

# In the last exercise, we looked at the summary statistics
# for diamond price by cut. If we look at the output table, the
# the median and quartiles are reasonably close to each other.

# diamonds$cut: Fair
#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     337    2050    3282    4359    5206   18570 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
# diamonds$cut: Good
#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     327    1145    3050    3929    5028   18790 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
# diamonds$cut: Very Good
#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     336     912    2648    3982    5373   18820 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
# diamonds$cut: Premium
#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     326    1046    3185    4584    6296   18820 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
# diamonds$cut: Ideal
#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     326     878    1810    3458    4678   18810 

# This means the distributions should be somewhat similar,
# but the histograms we created don't show that.

# The 'Fair' and 'Good' diamonds appear to have 
# different distributions compared to the better
# cut diamonds. They seem somewhat uniform
# on the left with long tails on the right.

# Let's look in to this more.

# Look up the documentation for facet_wrap in R Studio.
# Then, scroll back up and add a parameter to facet_wrap so that
# the y-axis in the histograms is not fixed. You want the y-axis to
# be different for each histogram.
```

Q3.9

```{r}

# to the code from the previous exercise to get

Q4.1

Q4.2

# What are your observations about the scatterplot of price vs x?

# The bulk of the data start at around x = 3.3 and price rises exponentially as it approaches 9. 
# There also seems to be an artificial ceiling in price around $19k.

Q4.3

# The Gapminder website contains over 500 data sets with information about
# the world's population. Your task is to continue the investigation you did at the
# end of Problem Set 3 or you can start fresh and choose a different
# data set from Gapminder.

# If you’re feeling adventurous or want to try some data munging see if you can
# find a data set or scrape one from the web.

# In your investigation, examine pairs of variable and create 2-5 plots that make
# use of the techniques from Lesson 4.

# Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a triennial international survey

# Our dataset is composed of 485,490 test results from the 2012 PISA testing results.
